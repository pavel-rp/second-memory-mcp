## What this register records

| Field | What it records |
| --- | --- |
| **Id** | `F-S<n>-<k>` |
| **Finding** | The fact, stated as a fact. |
| **Evidence** | What establishes it — a real path, an upstream package with its version or date, or a tracker record with its read date. |
| **Consequence** | What is weaker, riskier or differently-shaped because this is true. |
| **What is assumed rather than derived** | Where the finding rests on an inverted dependency, the specific inputs that were assumed, each cited by id. |
| **Handed to** | Who must act on it, and what they receive. |

## The standing rule OUT-18 owns

§ Constraints states feature-wide: *"Any further exception must be argued and registered the same
way; **an unregistered mutation is a blocking finding** — raised by OUT-18, which owns this
discipline, and landing in the findings register."*

**This register is that landing route.** A mutation the access audit surfaces that is not a
registered argued exception is recorded here as a **blocking finding with a named owner** — never
absorbed into the access audit's prose, and never reported only as a deviation from the zero-mutation
count. The audit reports the count *and* enumerates the single registered exception; anything outside
that becomes an entry here.

**At revision 1 the rule has fired zero times.** The access audit
(`01_production-evidence-and-the-access-audit.md` §3) reports zero production operations of any kind,
so there was no mutation to register, registered or otherwise. **Zero blocking findings on this
trigger** is a measured result, not an absence of checking.

### SUB-1

#### `F-S1-1` — `context_tokens` carries no principal binding of any kind

- **Id:** `F-S1-1`
- **Finding:** The `context_tokens` table has exactly three columns — `id` (text, primary key), `createdAt` (bigint, epoch ms) and `expiresAt` (bigint, epoch ms) — with a single index on `expiresAt`. There is no `sub`, no `azp`, no learner column, and no foreign key to any owner. A context token therefore identifies a session's existence and lifetime and nothing about whose session it is.
- **Evidence:** `src/infrastructure/db/schema.ts` at cutoff `546ee90`, 2026-08-25. The minting path is `src/server/server-context-tools.ts`, where `init_agent_context` calls `createContextToken()` in parallel with `buildLearnerContext()`, the latter fail-open (a failure yields `null`, not an error).
- **Consequence:** The token-bound identity decision C010 settled in `DR-C10-S8-2` — bind the principal to the `context_tokens` row **at mint time** — has no column to bind to today. Every gated tool call therefore passes a token that cannot attribute the request to a principal, which is precisely the gap OUT-7 and OUT-13 exist to close. It also means a pre-existing token cannot be grandfathered into a bound world, because there is nothing in the row from which to infer its owner: `DR-C10-S8-2`'s "reject, do not grandfather" position is the only available one, and this finding is why.
- **What is assumed rather than derived:** Nothing. The schema is read directly at a stated cutoff.
- **Handed to:** **SUB-4** (NEU-996), which binds the context token to a principal, and **SUB-13** (NEU-1006), which authors the DDL. Both receive the exact current column set above, so neither has to re-read it.

#### `F-S1-2` — C011's production-evidence base is empty of live observation, and the design proceeds on repository-derived evidence alone

- **Id:** `F-S1-2`
- **Finding:** Not one of the nine designed production spikes was executed. No production credential of any kind was available to the authoring environment — `SMOKE_PROD_CLIENT_ID`, `SMOKE_PROD_CLIENT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_ISSUER`, `AUTH_AUDIENCE`, `VPS_HOST` and `VPS_SSH_KEY` are all unset — so no token was minted for any principal shape and no read-only inspection of the production database, its metrics or its logs was performed. The single registered exception to the zero-mutation constraint was registered and **not exercised**.
- **Evidence:** `96_spike-register.md`, nine entries each recording `Result: not executed` with its reason; `93_open-items-and-provisional-register.md`, nine owned open items; `01_production-evidence-and-the-access-audit.md` §3, the access audit.
- **Consequence:** This is the finding that shapes the rest of the package, and it cuts in two directions. **The discipline held perfectly** — zero mutations, zero unregistered operations, zero unredacted captures, no shape substituted from another flow, and nothing fabricated to fill a register row. **And the evidence base the discipline was protecting is empty.** OUT-1 and OUT-5 must therefore derive the identity rule from `docs/adr/0001-oidc-issuer-and-dedicated-as-audience-binding.md` and from `src/transport/jwt-middleware.ts` rather than from an observed token, and must state that derivation as `[unconfirmed]` against `OI-S1-1` … `OI-S1-3`. C010 handed `OI-S1-2` forward once rather than observing it; **C011 has now handed an analogous set forward a second time**, and that is a fact about the program rather than about either package's diligence. Every downstream sub-task inherits nine `[unconfirmed]` platform claims instead of nine observations.
- **What is assumed rather than derived:** Nothing about the environment — the credential absence was probed directly. What *is* assumed downstream, and must be stated by its consumers rather than here, is the claim content of all three principal shapes; those assumptions are enumerated at `OI-S1-1`, `OI-S1-2` and `OI-S1-3`, with `OI-S1-3` additionally recording what OUT-1 and OUT-5 must assume in its absence.
- **Handed to:** **Every later C011 sub-task**, which receives nine owned open items with named owners and observable resolving events instead of nine observations; and **`NEU-896` at convergence**, which receives the program-level fact that the production-evidence gap has now survived two consecutive packages. Escalation is carried as `R13` in `92_risk-register.md`.

#### `F-S1-3` — The DCR principal shape cannot be observed through the endpoint the deployment's own CI uses, so no substitution is possible even in principle

- **Id:** `F-S1-3`
- **Finding:** A dynamically registered client receives a random, non-URL `client_id` of the form `dyn$<random>`, and **a DCR client can therefore never obtain `aud = <resource URL>` on Rauthy.** The `client_credentials` endpoint that `.github/workflows/cd-prod.yml` calls mints only the CI smoke principal's shape. The DCR shape is reachable only through the remote connector's dynamic-client-registration plus authorization-code flow, so it must be captured from an existing authenticated session.
- **Evidence:** `docs/adr/0001-oidc-issuer-and-dedicated-as-audience-binding.md`; the token request at `.github/workflows/cd-prod.yml`; the acceptance rule implemented in `src/transport/jwt-middleware.ts`, which admits `aud` equal to `AUTH_AUDIENCE`, or any `dyn$`-prefixed `aud`, or an absent `aud` with a `dyn$`-prefixed `azp`.
- **Consequence:** The temptation this closes off is a specific and plausible one: running the `client_credentials` grant three times and presenting the results as three shapes. That would be **silently wrong**, because the shapes differ in exactly the field the identity rule turns on — `sub`. A `client_credentials` capture has `sub` absent by design, so substituting it for the DCR shape would fabricate evidence for the proposition that DCR principals have no `sub`, which is the very question `OI-S1-3` exists to answer. The structural impossibility is therefore a **safeguard**, not merely an obstacle, and it is recorded so a later session does not rediscover the shortcut and take it.
- **What is assumed rather than derived:** Nothing. ADR-0001 states the `dyn$` form and the never-`aud`-equals-resource-URL consequence directly.
- **Handed to:** **SUB-2** (NEU-994), which must write the identity rule total over the `sub`-absent case without treating the three shapes as interchangeable; and any later session tempted to close `OI-S1-3` cheaply.

---

**SUB-1 register totals at revision 1:** three findings, `F-S1-1` … `F-S1-3`. **Zero blocking
findings** on the unregistered-mutation trigger, because zero production operations were performed.

**No contradiction with C010 was found.** SUB-1's facts were checked against C010's published
package — in particular `../C010-system-and-repository-architecture/decision-records/DR-C10-S10-2_deployment-shape.md`
(deployment shape, hosting/TLS/backup/monitoring non-discoverability) and `DR-C10-S8-2`
(token-bound identity) — and every one is consistent with it or cites it. **No amendment is routed
to `NEU-895` by SUB-1.** The check is recorded so SUB-17's audit can see that it ran and returned
empty, rather than having to infer it from the absence of an amendment.

### SUB-15

#### `F-S15-1` — **BLOCKING.** No RPO or RTO position can be set while the backups question is open

- **Id:** `F-S15-1`
- **Severity:** **Blocking**, per charter assumption 49 — *an objective that cannot be set at all, the RPO/RTO position in particular, is recorded as a blocking finding with a named owner rather than given an assumed number or left blank.*
- **Finding:** The two recovery objectives OUT-14 is required to state — **RPO** (maximum tolerable data loss) and **RTO** (maximum tolerable time to restore) — **cannot be set**. Neither has a number, and neither is left blank; both are carried by this record.
- **This is a finding about an objective, not about backups.** Whether production database backups exist is a separate fact with exactly one register record in this package: **`OI-S1-8`** in `93_open-items-and-provisional-register.md`, owned by SUB-1. **This entry raises no second record of that fact and does not restate it** — it cites `OI-S1-8` for the fact and records only the consequence for the objective. A reader meets one record for the unanswered production question and one for the operational objective that cannot be stated without the answer, never two competing records of the same question.
- **Evidence:** `15_operational-objectives-for-the-real-platform.md` §5 — the recovery tabletop, in which **four of six** recovery steps resolve to a capability the platform is not established to have. Detection: no monitoring is established (`OI-S1-9`). Code rollback: the deploy is `git reset --hard "$SHA"` against an off-repo compose stack with no rollback step (charter assumption 21). Schema rollback: no down-migrations; the migrator runs forward unconditionally at boot (`src/infrastructure/db/migrate.ts:38-50`). Data restore: `OI-S1-8`. The remaining two steps depend on the four.
- **Consequence:** Every downstream artifact that assumes a recovery position is assuming one nobody has stated. **SUB-7** (NEU-1001) cannot write a rollback action that assumes a restore. **SUB-9** (NEU-1003) cannot populate a backups column with anything but a citation. **SUB-12** cannot close an erasure-propagation cell for a backup copy. The data-lifecycle half of this package rests on a recovery position that does not exist, which is the exact gap this sub-task's problem slice names.
- **What is assumed rather than derived:** **Nothing.** No RPO and no RTO value is assumed, inferred, or defaulted. The two positions that *would* follow from each possible answer to `OI-S1-8` are published as **explicitly conditional** in `15_operational-objectives-for-the-real-platform.md` §5.4, so closing `OI-S1-8` yields an objective immediately without redoing the analysis — and neither conditional position is asserted. Both fall inside the tolerance envelope SUB-1's stand-in `A-33` already states.
- **Named owner:** **The creator, as sole maintainer and sole operator of the production deployment** — the only party who can state whether a backup arrangement exists, since none is discoverable in the repository. The same owner `OI-S1-8` names, deliberately, so the fact and the objective close together.
- **Resolving event:** **`OI-S1-8` closes.** On that event `OBJ-13` and `OBJ-14` in `15_operational-objectives-for-the-real-platform.md` §4 take the corresponding row of §5.4's conditional table, and this finding is downgraded from blocking to resolved.
- **Handed to:** **SUB-7** (NEU-1001), for every rollback action that assumes a restore; **SUB-9** (NEU-1003), for its backups column; **SUB-12**, for the erasure-propagation matrix. Each receives one id for the fact (`OI-S1-8`) and one for the objective (`F-S15-1`). **The direction is forward-only** — whether each in fact cites them is that sub-task's acceptance, not this one's.

#### `F-S15-2` — The per-subject rate limiter provides zero aggregate protection, so nothing defends the four-connection pool

- **Id:** `F-S15-2`
- **Severity:** High. Not blocking — the objective it concerns (`OBJ-3`) is stated with a named gap rather than being unsettable.
- **Finding:** The in-app rate limiter is keyed on the JWT subject (`src/transport/rate-limit-middleware.ts:58`) and admits **120 requests per 60 000 ms per subject** (`src/config/resolve-rate-limit-config.ts:24-25`). It therefore admits **N × 2 req/s** for N distinct subjects and imposes **no aggregate ceiling of any kind**. The resource it would have to protect — the shared Postgres pool — is fixed at **`max: 4`** (`src/infrastructure/db/client.ts:42`). Admitted load grows linearly with the learner population while the resource stays constant, so **the limiter cannot defend the pool at any learner count, by construction.**
- **Evidence:** The three `file:line` citations above, read at cutoff `86fb38a`. Derived threshold: at **N = 3** subjects the aggregate admitted rate is 6 req/s, which saturates 4 connections at any mean per-call database service time `t_db ≥ 0.667 s`. Full derivation and its bounded band at `15_operational-objectives-for-the-real-platform.md` §3.
- **Consequence:** `OBJ-3` — an aggregate admission ceiling — is an objective the platform has **no mechanism to enforce**. Beyond saturation, calls queue; past the pool's 5 000 ms acquisition timeout (`src/infrastructure/db/client.ts:44`) they **fail** rather than merely slow down. The shipped comment at `.env.example:76`–`:78` states the limiter's per-subject intent accurately, so this is a gap in what was built, not a defect against what was specified.
- **What is assumed rather than derived:** The **learner count** at which it bites depends on `t_db`, the mean per-call database service time, which is unobserved in production and carried as `OI-S15-3`. The band **2–200 concurrently active learners** is published in place of a point value, with both endpoints' bases stated.
- **Named owner:** **The creator, as sole maintainer and sole operator.**
- **Handed to:** **SUB-16** (NEU-999), which designs how a breach of `OBJ-1`/`OBJ-3` would be detected — and which inherits the fact that nothing currently would; **SUB-7** (NEU-1001), whose rollout stages are checked against these objectives.

#### `F-S15-3` — The transport and subject-binding maps have no eviction path but a clean session close, and the leak is masked by deploy churn

- **Id:** `F-S15-3`
- **Severity:** Medium.
- **Finding:** `src/transport/http.ts:82-83` declares `transports` and `sessionIdentity` side by side, keyed on the same MCP session id. `:212-218` — the `transport.onclose` handler — is the **only** eviction path; `:304-311` drains both on process shutdown. There is **no TTL, no idle sweep and no size bound**. A session abandoned without a clean close is therefore retained until the process restarts.
- **Evidence:** The `file:line` citations above at cutoff `86fb38a`. Because the two maps share a key and a lifecycle, the subject-binding map cannot break before the transport map: they are **one exposure, not two**, which is why this register carries one entry and not two.
- **Consequence:** The break mode is **monotonic memory growth**, not a learner-count threshold. It is currently masked by deployment churn: the measured deploy cadence is **≥1.36 restarts/day over 90 days and ≥3.29/day over the most recent 7** (`git rev-list --count origin/develop --grep="chore: bump version"` at `86fb38a`), and **every restart empties both maps**. The leak is real and is being contained by an accident of release cadence rather than by a mechanism — carried as `R-S15-2` in `92_risk-register.md`.
- **What is assumed rather than derived:** The threshold **in entries** is not stated. It needs a per-entry memory footprint that has never been measured (`OI-S15-4`) and a host RAM figure that is unknown (`C-26`, citing `OI-S1-9`). **No entry count is given**, rather than an estimated one.
- **Named owner:** **The creator, as sole maintainer and sole operator.**
- **Handed to:** **SUB-16** (NEU-999), for detection; **SUB-4** (NEU-996), which binds the context token to a principal and touches the same session lifecycle.

**SUB-15 register totals at revision 1:** three findings, `F-S15-1` … `F-S15-3`, of which **one is
blocking** (`F-S15-1`). All three carry a named owner. **Zero restate the backups fact**; `F-S15-1`
cites `OI-S1-8` for it and records only the objective that cannot be set.

**No contradiction with C010 was found.** SUB-15's facts were checked against C010's published
package — the tool-surface figure against `F-S5-3` / `F-S8-1`
(`../C010-system-and-repository-architecture/02_findings-register.md`), the MCP-boundary overhead
against `SPK-S6-1` (`../C010-system-and-repository-architecture/92_spike-register.md`), the 1 000 ms
latency budget against `A-25`
(`../C010-system-and-repository-architecture/08_per-state-authority-matrix.md`), and the deployment
shape against `DR-C10-S10-2` — and every one is consistent with it or cites it. **No amendment is
routed to `NEU-895` by SUB-15.** The check is recorded so SUB-17's audit can see that it ran and
returned empty, rather than having to infer it from the absence of an amendment.
